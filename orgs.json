Our camp is the only diabetes camp in the country that's integrated into a traditional summer camp, so our campers can attend with their family and friends without diabetes!  The ADA's role is to manage all of the medical care for the campers with diabetes so they can focus on having fun at summer camp.\r\n\r\nWe have two volunteer roles for students: medical assistants and diabetes counselors.  Medical assistants help campers with testing their blood sugar before meals and bedtime, treat low blood sugars, and fill in for other staff as needed.  We ask that medical assistants plan to attend camp for at least three days and two nights.  Diabetes counselors are assigned to a specific cabin and accompany their campers on activities throughout the week to help with diabetes management.  We ask that these volunteers attend camp for the whole week.  Room and board is provided for all volunteers.  No prior experience is needed, as there will be training before camp to teach you everything you need to know!\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in volunteering at camp, please visit diabetes.org/adacampsealth and click on the \"Work at Camp\" tile to find a link to the volunteer application.",
